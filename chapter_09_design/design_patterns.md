The design principles we discuss are somewhat vague and out of blue. So design
patterns are recorded with code examples from practice.

___
[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) is still the
bible in the field.

gurus in the industry.

He has another popular book: 
[Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)

Another note on [recurring](http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/recurring.pdf)
is a good design example.
